/** My Notes
 * This is the template file for the frontend display
 * You can use the config varibles here and other variables from plg_helloworld.php
 *
 * An important point to note is that the template file has the same scope as the plg_helloworld.php file.
 * What this means is that the variable $hello can be defined in the plg_helloworld.php file
 * and then used in the template file without any extra declarations or function calls.
