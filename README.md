# HelloWorld Plugin for Joomla

This is a ready to go Joomla plugin template that you can use to build your own plugins. I have added all the settings, elements and things I could find.

## What does it do?
This is a content plugin that replaces a user defined shortcode with some content; date, WYSIWYG content and a language sensitive Hello World statement.

## How to use the plugin
- install the plugin.
- configure the plugin how you want it.
- insert your shortcode into an article.
- load the newly saved article and you should see the shortcode has been replaced with the content you configured in the plugin admin.

## COMPATIBILITY
plg_helloworld is fully compatible with Joomla versions 3.x and 4.x.
